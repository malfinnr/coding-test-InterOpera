# Backend

This project is built with FastAPI and serves as the API layer for the Full Stack Sales Dashboard application.

It provides REST endpoints for sales data and a mock AI Q&A service.

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```shell
git clone <github-url>
cd my-backend-folder

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have pip or python installed, install them using Homebrew:

```shell
brew install python
```

Then, you can run the backend locally with:

```shell
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Open http://localhost:8000 to see your API.

Available Endpoints
GET /api/data – returns dummy sales data from dummyData.json

POST /api/ai – accepts a question and returns an answer from mockqa.json if similar, otherwise returns a default response

API Testing
You can test endpoints using http://localhost:8000/docs (Swagger UI automatically generated by FastAPI).

Deploy to production
For production, run the following command:

```shell
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
You can also use a production ASGI server like gunicorn with uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker.
```
